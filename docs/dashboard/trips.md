## Trips Price structure

Trip price depends on multiple factors,  which are:

- Distance and duration price
- Addons price
- Areas price
- Discounts from Promo or user wallet

### Distance and Duration price

When the user books a trip he will be requested to provide pickup and destination locations, then the system will calculate the distance and the duration that it will take the driver to complete the trip.

Then based on the distance and duration we got, the system will calculate the price depending on the **service Price** the user requested.

> **Note**: refer [Service Price section](dashboard/services.md#prices) for more details on how the service price is structured.



### Addons price

If the user requested additional addons with his booking, and the **Addons** have price. Then the customer will be charged extra for the addons. 

> **Note**: refer [Service Addons section](dashboard/services.md#addons) for more details.



### Areas price

Areas are locations when the user request a trip and set the destination to that location he will receive increase or reduction (depending on the area type) on his total trip price.

This additional increase or reduction will only include applied on the *distance and duration price*, and will not include prices of **Addons**, or discount from the promo and user wallet.

> **Note**: refer [Service Areas section](dashboard/services.md#areas) for more details



### Discounts from promo or user wallet

The user will receive a discount for his trip if he applied a **Promo** code, or he has amount in his wallet.

Discount amount depends on the promo configuration or the user wallet amount.

If the user applied promo code and he has amount in his wallet, then the promo code discount will take precedence over user wallet.
